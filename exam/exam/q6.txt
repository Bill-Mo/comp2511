I will select template pattern. The abstract class is pizza, which defines methods that adding sause, adding meat or vegetables, adding cheese, and cooking. The concrete class is different recipes, which define what sause to add, what meat and vegetables to add, what cheese to add, and how long to cook and so on. When we want to make a pizza, we simply create a specific pizza class and call all methods defined in the abstract pizza class.
