            - Let A = (ax, ay), B = (bx, by) be the points on our line segment
            - Our cicle C is presumed to be (0, 0) (i.e. centred)
                - Giving us points of x + y = RADIUS_OF_JUPITER^2

            We can then interpolate over the reals for t \in [0, 1] stating that
            all points on the line must be A + t(B - A).

            Points of intersection must satisfy both points at the same time.
            that is splitting the equations into components and then placing the
            result into the circle equation.

            x = ax + t(bx - ax)
            y = ay + t(by - ay)

            (placing result into circle equation)
            (ax + t(bx - ax))^2 + (ay + t(by - ay))^2 = RADIUS_OF_JUPITER^2

            expanding...
            t^2[(bx - ax)^2 + (by - ay)^2] + 2t[ax(bx - ax) + ay(by - ay)] + (ax^2 + ay^2 - RADIUS_OF_JUPITER^2) = 0
            which is just a quadratic, we can solve this for t by noting a previous restriction...
            'over the *REALS* for t \in [0, 1]'.  That is we can determine that indeed t is real
            and then after that validate it is within [0, 1].

            Determinant is b^2 - 4ac, and to ensure t is real this just has to be positive.
